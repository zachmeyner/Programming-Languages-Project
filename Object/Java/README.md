# Java
Java is an Object Oriented Language that runs in the Java Virtual Machine and I don't like it.

To install the right version of Java run 
```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk-headless
```
and 
```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk-headless
```
These are required to build and run the program.

To build and run change directory  to `animals/` and type in the terminal
```bash
javac Main.java
java Main.java
```
This will build the .class files required to run the program, and then run the program.
